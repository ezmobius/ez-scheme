ez-scheme --------------

This is a simple educational scheme interpreter that runs on ruby
1.9.* or rubinius. It needs the onig regexp engine for named captures
used in the lexer.

Source code is easy to read and understand. Plans to add a compiler
to rubinius bytecode that can run directly on the rbx vm.

Loosely based/ported from bobscheme by Eli Bendersky

released into the public domain

ez-scheme has been updated to use the non-deprecated 'rubygems/package_task' 
instead of 'rake/gempackagetask'

_Also, Rubinius is used by default if RVM is installed_
