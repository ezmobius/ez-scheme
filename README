ez-scheme --------------

This is a simple educational scheme interpreter that runs on ruby
1.9.* or rubinius. It needs the onig regexp engine for named captures
used in the lexer.

Source code is easy to read and understand. Plans to add a compiler
to rubinius bytecode that can run directly on the rbx vm.
